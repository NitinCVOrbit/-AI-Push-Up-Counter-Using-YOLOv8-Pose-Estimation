# 💪 AI Push-Up Counter Using YOLOv8 Pose Estimation

A complete AI-powered push-up counting system built using **YOLOv8 Pose**, **OpenCV**, and **Python**.  
The system detects pose landmarks, computes elbow–shoulder–wrist angles, aligns the body using a fixed reference line, and counts repetitions from **Left**, **Right**, and **Front** camera views.
